Lancer Mech Viewer

This application allows for users to create, read, update, and delete mechs from the tabletop game Lancer in a database. The mechs created have ids, names, stats, traits, and a core power. This application will let users keep a list of mechs from both the Lancer rulebook and original mech ideas of their own.
